# research_advanced_rag

## 1. Overview

The `research_advanced_rag` module focuses on enhancing the baseline RAG pipeline through advanced techniques such as hybrid retrieval, re-ranking, query transformation, and fallback response logic. The aim is to improve factuality, answer quality, and retrieval robustness across a variety of queries.

This module is designed for iterative experimentation, allowing the integration of novel retrieval and response-generation strategies beyond simple dense vector search.

## 2. Current Enhancements

The current implementation includes the following features:

### Hybrid Retrieval
- Combines dense vector-based search with traditional keyword (BM25) retrieval.
- Balances semantic understanding with exact keyword matching.
- Ensures important keyword-based matches are not missed by embedding-only methods.

### Relevance Thresholding
- Uses a configurable cosine similarity threshold (e.g., 0.7) to filter low-quality contexts.
- Reduces noisy or irrelevant information from influencing generation.

### Retrieval Fallback Strategy
- If the generative output fails quality checks (e.g., too short, off-topic), the system falls back to a direct retrieval-based response.
- Prevents hallucinated or nonsensical answers by relying only on trusted retrieved text.

### Prompt Reinforcement
- Uses system prompts that explicitly instruct the language model to avoid introducing external information.
- Helps improve factuality and transparency in the generated answers.

## 3. Planned Enhancements

This module is structured to support rapid iteration and integration of the following advanced strategies:

### Re-ranking with Cross-Encoders
- After retrieving top-k documents, a cross-encoder model can be used to re-score and re-rank the results based on deeper query-context interactions.

### Multi-hop Retrieval
- Chains multiple retrieval steps to answer complex or multi-part queries.
- For example: "What is X and how does it relate to Y?"

### Query Expansion and Rewriting
- Reformulates user queries using synonyms, templates, or question simplification.
- Enhances retrieval coverage for ambiguous or sparse queries.

### Conversational Context
- Maintains chat history for multi-turn interactions.
- Incorporates previous turns into both retrieval and prompt generation.

### Knowledge Graph Integration
- Augments retrieved documents with structured triples or schema-derived facts.
- Useful for domain-specific reasoning or entity-based lookup.

## 4. Quality Control Mechanisms

The system applies multiple checkpoints to ensure answer quality:

- **Similarity Thresholds**: Filters out irrelevant retrievals below a defined similarity score.
- **Response Validation**: Detects issues such as hallucinations, token artifacts, and question echoing.
- **Fallback Safety Net**: Ensures that users always receive a response grounded in retrieved text, even if the generative model fails.

## 5. Evaluation Strategy

To evaluate the effectiveness of advanced RAG strategies, we use a combination of:

- **Answer faithfulness**: Is the response strictly grounded in the provided context?
- **Answer relevance**: Does the response directly address the query?
- **Context utilization**: Are retrieved documents appropriately used in the generation?
- **Retrieval diversity**: Are hybrid results offering complementary value?
- **System robustness**: Does fallback logic reliably handle failure cases?

## 6. Future Work

- Integrate cross-encoder rerankers (e.g., `ms-marco` fine-tuned BERT)
- Enable multiple retrieval pipelines and compare hybrid, dense-only, and sparse-only modes
- Log and analyze failure types to refine fallback conditions
- Add an evaluation dashboard for real-time testing and qualitative review
- Experiment with structured prompts for fact-extraction tasks
